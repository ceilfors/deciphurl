=========

> deciphurl enables a user to highlight a text, press win+c, and open the referred URL in the browser.

deciphurl connects human with URL again. In a high bandwidth communication organization, often people are talking 
in the same context by using computer as their mediation system. They use email, IM, or a dedicated chat room.
Some of these programs doesn't allow hyperlinks, and some people just forgot to put them or find long URL annoying.
deciphurl is built to help this situation.
